To answer the question: of all the players the agent has seen batting 100/300, how good did they turn out to be?

```{r}
N <- 10e6
sims <- tibble(
  true_avg = rbeta(N, 81, 219),
  hits = rbinom(N, 300, true_avg)
)
```
See how the distribution of capabilities of those ones hitted 100
```{r}
sims %>% 
  filter(hits == 100) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(true_avg))+
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..))+
  geom_density() 

sims %>% 
  filter(hits == 100) %>% 
  pull(true_avg) %>% 
  summary
```
See how the distribution of capabilities of those ones hitted 60, 80, 100 compares

this is the essence of posterior distribution
```{r}
sims %>% 
  filter(hits %in% c(60, 80, 100)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(true_avg, color = as.factor(hits)))+
  geom_density()
  
```
